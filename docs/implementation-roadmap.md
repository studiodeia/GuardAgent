  fallback: "Rule-based detection"
  
scaling_challenges:
  risk: "Cold start latency in Cloud Run"
  mitigation: "Minimum instances + warm-up"
  fallback: "GKE Autopilot deployment"
  
integration_complexity:
  risk: "OpenMCP protocol changes"
  mitigation: "Version compatibility matrix"
  fallback: "REST API fallback"
```

### Operational Risks
```yaml
team_capacity:
  risk: "Limited ML expertise"
  mitigation: "External ML consultant"
  fallback: "Simplified rule-based approach"
  
compliance_requirements:
  risk: "LGPD/AI Act changes"
  mitigation: "Legal review checkpoints"
  fallback: "Conservative data handling"
```
